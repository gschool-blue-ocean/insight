## Description ##

Insight is a powerful Learning Management System (LMS) designed to transform education through advanced technology. This full-stack web application is built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js), delivering a seamless and interactive learning experience.

## Primary Tech Stack ##

Frontend:
- <img align="center" alt="React" width="30px" style="padding-right:10px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/react/react-original.svg" /> [React](https://reactjs.org)
  
- <img align="center" alt="Tailwindcss" width="30px" style="padding-right:10px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/tailwindcss/tailwindcss-plain.svg" /> [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

Backend:
 - <img align="center" alt="NodeJS" width="30px" style="padding-right:10px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/nodejs/nodejs-original.svg" /> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
 - <img align="center" alt="NodeJS" width="30px" style="padding-right:10px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/express/express-original.svg" /> [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - <img align="center" alt="PostgresSQL" width="30px" style="padding-right:10px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/v2.15.1/icons/postgresql/postgresql-original.svg" /> [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)

## Tech used

- [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) - Module bundler, transpiler and dev server.
- [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerization framework for dev and deployment.
- [`Node Cluster Module`](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) -  Utilized for enhancing application performance by distributing workloads across multiple processes for improved efficiency and response times.
- [`loadtest`](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) -  Employed for load testing and assessing the robustness of the application's node clustering implementation.
- [`ChartJS`](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) - Utilized for seamlessly creating interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs on web applications.
- [`Sockets.io`](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) - Integrated for establishing real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients.

# Development Setup #

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/gschool-blue-ocean/insight`
2. Install dependencies for both client and API directories : `npm install`
3. Set up your environment variables (database connection, etc.): Create a `.env` file
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Project Structure ##

- `/client`: Frontend code built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- `/server`: Backend code powered by Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
